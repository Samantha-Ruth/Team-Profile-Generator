# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

This project was an activity to link together node, npm inquirer, and the javascript testing framework "jest" as well as using constructors, classes, and Object Oriented Development.  The goal of this project was to automatically generate website populated with employees entered by the user from the command line.   

This project helped me understand how the concept of Object Oriented Development and running tests to ensure the code will work correctly. I learned how to install Jest and make sure it is one of the developmental dependencies in the node_modules.  I also learned how to create constructors and class objects and methods.  I learned how to refactor the code, making multiple, easier to read files instead of one long coding file and how to create an extention class that uses inheritance to pass properties onto other objects.  I reinforced how to use the node file system to write new files and copy o thers. I also learned how to destructure arrays and objects to create variables from object properties.

## Installation

If the user already has node installed on their device, they can download this project and run "npm init" and then "npm install" to download the dependencies.  If they are interested in running the tests, enter "npm i --save-dev jest".  Next, the user should enter "node index.js" into their command line to start the user prompts.

## Usage

The user will receive a series of prompts, asking for members of their team.  It will start out with the manager, and then ask whether or not the user would like to enter other employees, either an engineer or an intern.  The user can enter as many engineers and interns as they would like for their team.  

When the user is finished entering their information, an html file is created with "My Team" on top, and then a listing of the members of the team, their role, their ID, their email, and their office number, gitHub username, and school based on whether they are managers, engineers, or interns, respectively.  When the user clicks on an email, an autopopulated email server pops up.  When they click on a gitHub address, they are taken to that gitHub user's homepage.
